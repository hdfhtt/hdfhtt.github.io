  Hi, my name is Hadif Hatta. I am a computer science student, currently
  in my final year, pursuing Bachelor of Computer Science (BCompScience) @
  International Islamic University Malaysia. I started my CS journey
  since high school, from scripting a gamemode, to developing my own
  apps. My biggest achievement so far to have an app that have 100K of
  downloads on Google Play Store.

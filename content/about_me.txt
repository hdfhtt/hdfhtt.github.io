Hi, my name is Hadif Hatta. I am a computer science student, currently
in my final year, pursuing Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science @
International Islamic University Malaysia. I started my CS journey
since high school, from scripting a gamemode, to developing my own
apps. My biggest achievement so far to have an app that have 100K of
downloads on Google Play Store.
